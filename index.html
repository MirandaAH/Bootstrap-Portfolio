			<p>My name is Miranda Hane. I have been a comedic actress since I was 10 years old. I received an Associate's Degree in Theatre Arts from a community college. One day, I found a website called <span>CodeAcademy</span> and fell in love with coding. It was pretty daunting at first. I started learning HTML/CSS and struggled in teaching myself how to learn.  I thought it would be impossible to remember everything I was being shown and I wasn't ever going to really understand any of it. 
			<p>The next day, I sat down at my computer and picked up where I left off the day before. As I sat there, completing the lesson I was on, everything began to click. I started connecting everything I learned and started to truly understand what I was reading and what it meant. I remember jumping out of my chair with joy when I fixed my first bug. When I felt that immense joy of putting my head down, working hard and solving a problem all on my own, I knew this was something I was truly passionate about.</p>
